### AI-powered Resume–Job Matching System (Flask + React)


A full-stack AI-powered web application that analyzes how well a resume matches a given job description. The system provides an **explainable match score**, highlights **matched and missing skills**, and gives a clear verdict to help candidates understand their skill gaps.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Upload resume and job description (PDF)
* Skill-based matching using a curated skill list
* NLP-based text similarity scoring
* Explainable output with matched & missing skills
* Overall compatibility score with verdict
* Clean and interactive React UI

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The application combines **rule-based skill matching** with **NLP techniques** to avoid unrealistic or misleading scores.

1. **Text Extraction**
   Resume and job description PDFs are parsed to extract raw text.

2. **Skill Extraction**
   A predefined skill ontology is used to detect explicit skills from both documents.

3. **Scoring Logic**

   * Skill overlap score (higher weight)
   * Text similarity score using TF-IDF + cosine similarity
   * Final score is a weighted combination of both

4. **Explainability**
   The system returns:

   * Matched skills
   * Missing skills
   * Overall score
   * Verdict (Good fit / Partial match)

## 🧱 Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React (Vite), CSS
**Backend:** Flask (Python)
**AI / NLP:** TF-IDF, cosine similarity (scikit-learn)
**Other:** PDF parsing, REST API
